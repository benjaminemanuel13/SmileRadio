Currently tested over local LAN and it works.

I am hosting the Client (Blazor) project on IIS on server machine.
Then run the Server App on same machine.

Connect over LAN (I used port 5000) - don't forget to open port 5000 on Windows firewall.

note: this was 100% Vibe Coded, in literally 20 mins (spent more time setting up IIS etc than coding it).
